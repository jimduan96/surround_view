# in current SHELL environment in the following way:
# 1. try to find the */s32v234_sdk folder (Vision SDK root) in current tree directory and set it.
# 2. set to S32V234_SDK_ROOT environment variable if the above fails.
# 3. an error will be reported if the above fails too.
# NOTE:
#  - S32V234_SDK_ROOT variable points to the last Vision SDK installed. It supports the OS-style path.
#  - CURR_SDK_ROOT supports only Unix-style path.
